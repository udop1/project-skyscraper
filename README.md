# Project Skyscraper
My brief was to create a Cyberpunk themed website that my client wanted to promote their new game called 'Project Skyscraper'. They wanted the website to look like it was in the game universe itself.


To fulfil this I added scrolling text banners with console-like text and scrolling adverts which they'd designed the images for. The scrolling adverts were made using a flexible slideshow library called Splide. They also wanted an annoying pop-up that displayed one of their adverts randomly after the page loaded to further add to the Cyberpunk feel and for the website to work on mobile devices.
